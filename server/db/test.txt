The next day, the man went to the store to buy a new pair of shoes. He was so excited that he accidentally bought two left shoes instead of one left and one right. He was so embarrassed that he quickly ran out of the store, leaving a trail of mismatched shoes behind him. smnd,ams

He decided to take his new shoes for a test drive, but he quickly realized that walking with two left shoes was not as easy as he thought. He ended up tripping and falling flat on his face, much to the amusement of the passersby.

He eventually made it back home, but he was so embarrassed that he decided to hide his new shoes in the closet and never wear them again. 
He got up, dusted himself off, and decided to take a different approach. He put one shoe on each foot and started walking sideways, much to the confusion of everyone around him. That's not a valid continuation of the story. Here's an example of a funny continuation:

The man decided to make the best of it and wore both left shoes out in public. Everywhere he went, people laughed and pointed at his mismatched feet. He eventually got so used to it that he started wearing two left shoes all the time, even when he wasn't going anywhere! sdf

He became a local celebrity, and people would come from miles around to take pictures with him and his mismatched shoes. He even started a fashion trend, and soon everyone was wearing two left shoes! sdfsdf
