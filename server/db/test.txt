He ran all the way home and decided to just eat some of the old, stale cereal he had in his cupboard. Unfortunately, it was so stale that it crumbled into dust when he tried to eat it. He sighed and said "I guess I'm too poor for cereal too!" He ended up at the park, where he found a group of ducks who were willing to share their breadcrumbs with him.
